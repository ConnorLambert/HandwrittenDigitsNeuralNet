# HandwrittenDigitsNeuralNet
A Research project aimed at training a neural network to read handwritten digits.

Conducted By: Connor Lambert

Under the Guidance of: Dr. Dia Ali


Dependencies:
Python 3.5
Numpy

Execution:
After dependencies are installed, "python test.py" will execute the program.  The input parameters are as follows: Parameter 1 being the Driver file, test.py, (optional) Parameter 2 is the number of Epochs, (optional) Parameter 3 is the size of our Batches, and (optional) Parameter 4 is the Learning Rate.  If Parameters 2, 3, and 4 are not given, the program runs with the values of: 30 Epochs, a Batch Size of 10, and a Learning Rate of 3.0.
